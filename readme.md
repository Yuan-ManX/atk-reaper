# ATK for Reaper : Read Me

This is the Ambisonic Toolkit (ATK) as a JSFX plugin suite for Reaper.
It can be used with Reaper on OSX and Windows, and can also be used with
other VST hosts on the Windows platform using the ReaJS plugin. ReaJS is
part of the [ReaPlugs](http://reaper.fm/reaplugs/index.php) plugin suite.

The Ambisonic Toolkit (ATK) is intended to bring together a number of
tools and methods for working with Ambisonic surround sound. The
intention is for the toolset to be both ergonomic and comprehensive,
providing both classic and novel algorithms to creatively manipulate and
synthesise complex Ambisonic soundfields.

The tools are framed for the user to think in terms of the soundfield
kernel. By this, it is meant the ATK addresses the holistic problem of
creatively controlling a complete soundfield, allowing and encouraging
the composer to think beyond the placement of sounds in a sound-space
and instead attend to the impression and image of a soundfield. This
approach takes advantage of the model the Ambisonic technology presents,
and is viewed to be the idiomatic mode for working with the Ambisonic
technique.

We hope you enjoy the ATK!

# Installing

&nbsp;

## Requirements

* ATK for Reaper requires [Reaper 5.0 or above](http://reaper.fm).

&nbsp;

## Windows

1. Start Reaper.
2. From the Options menu choose "Show REAPER resource path in explorer/finder".
3. Unzip the ATK for Reaper archive.
4. Follow the instructions suggested by the folder names in the unzipped archive. If the Data and Effects folders already contains ATK subfolder from a previous install, these can safely be deleted before copying.

&nbsp;

## Mac OSX

When you run the installer, the required files are installed into the following folders in your home library folder:

    ~/Library/Application Support/ATK
    ~/Library/Application Support/Reaper/ColorThemes
    ~/Library/Application Support/Reaper/Effects/ATK
    ~/Library/Application Support/Reaper/presets

&nbsp;

Additionally an alias (or rather a symlink) is created at:

    ~/Library/Application Support/Reaper/Data/ATK

&nbsp;

that points to:

    ~/Library/Application Support/ATK

&nbsp;

If you are using Ambisonic Toolkit with SuperCollider as well,
the convolution kernels are installed in the same place and have
the exact same content. We do not expect this to cause any conflicts.

If you want to take a look at the installed files and do not see the
Library folder in Finder, please press the ALT button while clicking
the "Go" menu in Finder. The Library folder will show up as an
additional option.

&nbsp;

# List of Changes

## Version 1.0.0.b11

*Released 2021-11-04*

Another maintenance release, ensuring compatibiility with Reaper v. 6.38

* Pantophonic2D and Periphonic3D decoders now work with Reaper vv.6.38 - [#75](https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/atk-reaper/issues/75)
* Fixed typo in PsychoShelf filter, but the filter remains unstable - [#78](https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/atk-reaper/issues/78)
* Speed of sound corrected from 333 to 343 m/s in Proximity and Near Field transforms - [#76](https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/atk-reaper/issues/76)

Under the hood updates:

* macOS installer disk image built using more recent version of create-dmg (1.0.9)
* Updated atk-matrices to v. 1.0.0
* Updated cookdsp library to v. 0.5 - [#74](https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/atk-reaper/issues/74)

## Version 1.0.0.b10

*Released 2016-09-12*

**Changes in this version**

This is mostly a mainenance release fixing a number of issues introduced or discovered in beta 9.

* Added pre-install script to OSX installer that erases earlier versions of the `REAPER/Effects/ATK` folder, preventing possible conflicts when a newer version is installed on top of an older one (issue #47).
* Loading only the parts of CookDSP that are actually used, speeding up plugin load time on Windows (isse #46).
* Fixed bug where stereo encoder would encode left channel to the right and vica versa (issue #56).
* Fixing issue where rotation angle got mixed up in RotateTiltTumble transform plugin (issue #51).

## Version 1.0.0.b9

*Released 2016-07-24*

**IMPORTANT: This version breaks backwards compatibility regarding how azimuth angles are described in encoders, tranformsers and decoders.**

**It also breaks backwards compatibility with respect to channel configurations for the Quad Decoder.**

*Quad decoder*

The Quad decoder now returns 4 channels only: L - R - Ls - Rs. Refer to the discussion in issue [#26](https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/atk-reaper/issues/26) for further details.

*Azimuth angles*

Azimuth angles are now defined to be positive in the counter-clockwise direction. The new azimuth convention aligns with standard ambisonic conventions, and description of azimuths is now consistent between the SuperCollider and Reaper implementations of ATK. 

This is a change from prior beta-versions up to and including v.1.0.0.b7, and unfortunately it breaks backwards compatibility. As an example a planewave encoding done using previous beta verison now will be mirrored between left and right.

When we initially set out to make the Reaper port of ATK, we wanted this new design from the start. However, due to limitations in Reaper version 4 we had to implement azimuth as positive in clockwise rather than counter-clockwise direction. This was disussed in the paper [ATK Reaper: The Ambisonic Toolkit as JSFX plugins](http://www.ambisonictoolkit.net/assets/files/2014-ICMC-ATK-Reaper.pdf) by T. Lossius and J. Anderson, presented at the joint ICMC/SMC conference in Athens in 2014:

> Due to current limitations in the Reaper JSFX API, there are some considerations to be made with respect to description of azimuths. The desired behaviour is that azimuths increase anti-clockwise. At the same time it is also preferable that for sources coming from the front half circle, moving the azimuth slider to the right results in the direction of the sound also moving clockwise to the right, similar to what happens when moving a regular stereo pan pot. The Harpex and Blue Ripple plugins both functions this way. In order to achieve this, horizontal azimuth sliders will need to be implemented with increasing values to the left. This is however currently not supported in Reaper JSFX, and for the time being ATK for Reaper uses azimuth values described according to a navigational coordinate system. If Reaper in the future is updated to support sliders with increasing values to the left, this design decision is likely to be reconsidered, and changed to use acoustic conventions.

REAPER v.5 added support for JSFX sliders with increasing values to the left, and hence this change is now being implemented. This implied changes to the following plugins:

* Changed (breaks backwards compatibility)
    * Encoders
        * Planewave encoder now has positive azimuth in counter-clockwise direction (issue #34)
    * Transforms
        * Direct transform now has positive azimuth in counter-clockwise direction (issue #35)
        * Dominate transform now has positive azimuth in counter-clockwise direction (issue #36)
        * FocusPressPullZoom transform now has positive azimuth in counter-clockwise direction (issue #37)
        * Mirror transform now has positive azimuth in counter-clockwise direction (issue #38)
    * Decoders:
        * Mono decoder now has positive azimuth in counter-clockwise direction (issue #40)

If you need to maintain Reaper projects created using ATK for Reaper beta versions prior to 1.0.0.b8, you can insert a mirror transform 

**Other changes in this version**

* New features
    * New Reaper-theme, provided by Michael McCrea - When selecting the MultiChanMix theme in Reaper, two new Track Mixer Panel Layouts are available with larger multi-channel level meters (issue #23).
    * New encoder: AmbiXtoB - encodes a first order AmbiX format signal to FuMa B-format for further processing in Ambisonic Tooit. Supports 3DN and S3DN.
    * New decoder: BtoAmbiX - decodes a FuMa B-format (used for processing in Ambisonic Tooit) to first order AmbiX format. Supports 3DN and S3DN. S3DN is used to author ambisonic sound files for Google VR 360Â° videos.
    * Spreader encoder: Now support all sample rates equal to or higher than 44.1 kHz (issues #20, #30).
    * UHJ encoders: Now support all sample rates equal to or higher than 44.1 kHz (issues #20, #31).
    * Binaural decoder: CIPIC and Listen HRTFs now work woth all samle rates equal to or higher than 44.1 kHz (issues #18, #29, #32, #33).
* Refactoring (these changes should not affect the behaviour of plugins):
    * Updated to install atk-kernels v. 1.2.1.
    * Installs atk-matrices, so far used for AmbiX conversions.
    * ATK for Reaper now uses v. 0.3 of the CookDSP library by Olivier BÃ©langer: https://github.com/belangeo/cookdsp
    * Introducing ATK library header file, simplifies maintenance of libraries and library dependencies (issue #39).
    * Have started to implement matrix library as object-oriented classes, adding new feature to read matrix file from disk. This is used for the AmbiX encoders and decoders.
* On a side note:
    * A new repository has been set up providing [a set of example Ambisonic Toolkit Reaper projects](https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/atk-reaper-examples). This will soon be available from the ATK web site as a separate download.

## Version 1.0.0.b7
*Released 2016-05-23*

* Refactoring (these changes should not affect the behaviour of plugins):
    * The repository has been moved to [Github](https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/atk-reaper). If you experience problems with the installers in this version, [please let us know](https://github.com/ambisonictoolkit/atk-reaper/issues).
    * Removed redundant arguments from `drawBackgroundImage()` function - #16.
* New features:
    * Stereo, Quadrophonic, 5_0 and Pantohponic 2D decoders: Added GUI for level metering and display of speaker positions/channel numbering
    * New decoder: Periphonic 3D - 3D dual ring, regular cylindrical decoder, with GUI for level metering and display of speaker positions/channel numbering

## Version 1.0.0.b6
*Released 2015-11-04*

* In Reaper 5 the name of the plugins are retrieved from the desc field rather than filename. The desc field of these plugins was previously used to provide documentation on the plugin. Now it has been changed to have more useful names of the plugins.

## Version 1.0.b5
*Released 2015-08-07*

* Added new utils plugin: MuteSoloChannels - can be used to mute or solo individula channels of a four-channel track. This can be useful when monitoring effect processing of signals within a Bformat => BtoA => SoundFXs => AtoB => B-format signal processing chain.
* The 4channels plugins is now properly installed on Windows.
* Set up the infrastructure required to provide Factory Presets for plugins. A number of presets are provided for the MuteSoloChannels effect.
* Fixed bug in binaural decoder that would prevent the use of Spherical HRTFs at 88.2kHz and 96khz. Thanks to Juan Pampin for pointing this out!
* Resolved: JS plugin automation data generated by GUI is not always properly recorded. This was a bug in Reaper, and was fixed in Reaper 4.75. Issue on the Reaper issue tracker:  http://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=147151

## Version 1.0.b4
*Released 2014-10-04*

* New utility plugin "4channels": Can be used to extract 4-channel A- or B-format recording from sound file with additional channels, e.g. recorded in the field using a portable recorder such as Tascam DR680 or Sound Devices 788T.
* Fixed an issue where matrix-based encoders could cause very loud signals if used on a track with insufficient number of channels.


## Version 1.0.b3
*Released 2014-09-09*

* Fixed issue where multi-channel matrix-based decoders could blow up when used on 2-channel (stereo) tracks.
* Encode/UHJ: Corrected description of plugin in GUI
* Decode/Binaural: Improving text describing in GUI of this plugin
* Decode/5_0: Text description now provides information on output channels
* Decode/Quad: Text description now provides information on output channels

## Version 1.0.b2
*Released 2014-09-3*

* Fixed issue where matrix-based transform plugins could blow up when used on 2-channel (stereo) tracks.
* Fixed issue that prevented Omni encoder from producing sound.
* OSX installer is now distributed as disk image.
* Creation of Zip archive for Windows distribution is automoated using a Terminal script.
* Info for beta testers has been merged into this readme document.
* This Readme file is now versioned and maintained as markdown document, and converted to html by installer script using [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). A minimum of CSS is used for it to look OK as a stand-alone HTML document as well as in the OSX installer.

&nbsp;
